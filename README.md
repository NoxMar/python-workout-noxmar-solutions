# Solutions for exercises from "Python Workout" by Reuven M. Lerner

I am using this book to speed up my transition from mostly Java and C++ to Python. This repository is mainly as an archive for my solutions however if you find any code found here useful in any way fill free to use it since it is basically in the public domain (as per [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)).

## Usage

Due to the structure of the "Python Workout" chapter solutions are not runnable in and of themselves as files. Their intended usage is to be run against tests from [the author's repo](https://github.com/reuven/python-workout) (if applicable). However, due to the lack of license in the aforementioned repo, I cannot include those tests here. I will run those tests before pushing any code to the main branch.

## Dependencies

This code has no "production" dependencies besides Python's standard library. Development dependencies are listed in [requirements_dev.txt](./requirements_dev.txt).

## License

This code is licensed under [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) meaning it is basically in the public domain.
